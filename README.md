# Ozempic-impact-on-patients
This Project is about Understanding the Impact of Ozempic on Obese and Hypertensive Patients. 

The primary goal of this assignment is to delve into the effects of Ozempic on obese and
hypertensive patients aged 40-75. A key focus is on addressing endogeneity to estimate the
treatment effect accurately. Through exploratory data analysis, data merging, and the application of
advanced statistical techniques, we will uncover causal relationships and provide insights into the
dataset

## Outcome: Treatment effect of -13.95 suggests that the use of Ozempic has a negative impact on the target patient population. Meaning, on average, patients who received Ozempic experienced a decrease in the target outcome compared to those who didn't receive the treatment.
